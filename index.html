        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">I'm Finn, a driven and enthusiastic people person. I'm passionate about finding ways to apply smart technology to make others' lives easier. Right now I work on Government IT transformation projects with Assurity Consulting. We bring modern development / operations practices into software teams to supercharge their development / delivery processes. This demands communication, collaboration, and constant innovation to create lasting improvement for the clients we work with.</p>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">My strengths lie in my logical thought process and attention to detail, which give me great capacity to solve complicated problems. I learn quickly and always work towards making validated progress that can be well communicated. I have a good sense for metrics, measurement, and assessing the impacts of my decisions and the work I do. I've found that my passion, honest manner, and sense of humor have meant I consistently find firm friends among like minded people in the places I work.</p>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">When I'm not at the office or working on my next idea for a startup, I'm reading up on the latest tech or learning something new. A background in hospitality has given me a passion for great food paired with good company - whether cooking in or eating out. I travel whenever I can, with as little luggage as possible, and like to avoid the typical tourist grind. In the rest of my spare time I write code, take photos, and drink good beer.</p>

                        <p class="title">Consultant</p>
                        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">As a consultant engaged in transformation work, there is a demand to be an excellent communicator and a subject matter expert. The clients I've worked with are mostly government and corporate IT departments, and face varied and complex challenges in the move to a modern software world. My startup background has allowed me to bring well communicated examples to the table and drive the adoption of modern practices; from feature prioritisation through to automated acceptance testing and deployment.</p>
                        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Throughout this work I strive to remain product and technique agnostic, recognising that implementing solutions that empower product teams and facilitate visibility drive improvement that lasts. Communicating the principles driving this change, along with the outcomes that result, has enabled me to engage with stakeholders at all levels to navigate complicated internal politics.</p>
                        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">My current placement at the Ministry of Social Development has me working solo to implement automated infrastructure which will facilitate the move from siloed disciplines to agile, cross functional teams.</p>

                        <p class="dates">August 2014 - Present</p>
                        <p class="title">Front End Developer | Freelance</p>
                        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Although my full-time work has highly technical elements, the client mix results in mostly enterprise languages, platforms, and software. Among several personal projects, Lewis Fredericks has kept me in constant contact with modern web languages and allowed me to develop my accompanying skills. The role involves maintaining an online presence, digital marketing, and analytics for a rapidly growing New Zealand brand.</p>
                        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Programming has been supplemented by light design work, image and asset manipulation, and shaping the direction for the brand's digital presence. MVP experimentation and interation have allowed me to deliver three distinct iterations of the site to date, with a fourth under construction. Each version has focussed on building the brand image and improving the user-experience. The unique nature of each Lewis Fredericks frame has challenged me to develop and deliver a solution that allows for a one-on-one consultation to occur to select the perfect pair for each customer.</p>
                        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">The current and upcoming version build on the Jekyll blogging framework - extending it to provide lightweight CMS functionality. This allows the non-technical company founders to maintain and update the site content while keeping their costs well below a Shopify or Wordpress subscription. Most recently I have begun work on the founders' second brand, <a target="_blank" href="http://porterpackaging.co.nz/">Porter Packaging</a>.</p>

                        <p class="title">Founder</p>
                        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">I was selected as one of 29 entrepreneurial Company Founders to partake in the second intake of New Zealand’s only startup accelerator. Lightning Lab takes on ten young companies and provides investment and twelve weeks of intense direction to help them raise seed capital on Demo Day, at the completion of the programme.</p>
                        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">My team and I founded TradeIntel, an analytics platform for Trade Me, New Zealand’s online auction platform. We provided information &amp; insight to large sellers on competitive factors, and changes in demand across the categories of goods sold on the site. My roles were mostly customer and product oriented: I owned Sales &amp; Marketing, and was responsible for our user-experience and front-end design. Through constant communication with our early adopters, I ensured we were building a platform that our converted customers would use, and keep using. This involved sustained communication with customers and the team, and management of feature rollout across our userbase. MVP testing and fast iteration allowed us to transform our clunky, subscription-based web system into a seamless, pay-per-use report delivery service, providing more value to our customers and increasing revenue.</p>
                        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">It was here that I learned the importance of validating my assumptions when building product, and that there is no substitute for getting out of the building and into the real world. Ultimately, a failure to reach a commercial agreement with Trade Me over the use of auction data lead to the shutdown of the company.</p>

                        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Responsible for the daily operations of Wellington’s largest &agrave;  la carte fine dining restaurant, where I was in charge of managing stock, staff, and customers in a high quality, high pressure, high turnover environment. This varied from orchestrating weddings and corporate functions, to serving the Prime Minister, to running The Hobbit Premiere after party for the cast &amp; crew. The size of the establishment and the scale of the team demanded expertise, diplomacy, and constant communication.</p>
                        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Managing every detail of the customer experience from end-to-end, and working with passionate, talented people is what really drove me in this role. From the moment customers picked up the phone to make a reservation, till they posted a great review; providing a consistently high level of service was the number one priority. In the interest of continuous improvement I implemented several internal initiatives, including composing menu glossaries and wine tasting notes to upskill and retain talented staff.</p>

        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">I spent the first ten years of my life in the south of Spain, growing up in a tiny village nestled in the Alpujarras. At age eleven my family moved to Nelson, New Zealand, where I attended Nelson College for seven years. I studied Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Canterbury for another two, before the earthquakes forced a move to Wellington. I cross-credited to a Software Development Diploma at Weltec which I completed while working full time.</p>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Having grown up in Spain, I am a fluent Spanish speaker, and travel through continental Europe has given me some French and Italian. I hold current New Zealand and Irish passports, and a full New Zealand Driver's licence.</p>
