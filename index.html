        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">I'm Finn, a driven and enthusiastic people person. I'm passionate about applying smart technology to make other people's lives easier. Right now I work on Government IT transformation projects with Assurity Consulting. We bring modern development / operations practices into sofware teams to supercharge their development / delivery processes. This demands communication, collaboration, and constant innovation to create lasting improvement for the clients we work with.</p>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">My strengths lie in my logical thought process and attention to detail, which give me great capacity to solve complicated problems. I learn quickly and always work towards making validated progress that can be well communicated. I have a good sense for metrics, measurement, and assessing the impacts of my decisions and the work I do. I've found that my passion, honest manner, and sense of humor have meant I consistently find firm friends among like minded people in the places I work.</p>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">When I'm not at the office or working on my next idea for a startup, I'm reading up on the latest tech or learning something new. A hospitality background growing up has given me a passion for great food paired with good company - whether cooking in or eating out. I travel whenever I can, with as little luggage as possible, and like avoid the typical tourist grind. In the rest of my spare time I write code, take photos, and drink good beer.</p>

            <p class="dates">March 2014 - July 2014</p>
            <p class="title">Founder</p>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">I was selected as one of 29 entrepreneurial Company Founders to partake in the second intake of New Zealand’s only startup accelerator. Lightning Lab takes on 10 young companies and provides investment and twelve weeks of intense direction to help them raise seed capital on Demo Day, at the completion of the programme.</p>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">My team and I founded TradeIntel, an analytics platform for Trade Me, New Zealand’s online auction platform. We provided information &amp; insight to large sellers on competitive factors, and changes in demand across the categories of goods sold on the site. My roles were mostly customer and product oriented: I owned Sales &amp; Marketing, and was responsible for our user-experience and front-end design. In constantly communicating with our early adopters, I ensured we were building a platform that our converted customers would use, and keep using. This involved sustained communication with customers and the team, and management of feature rollout across our userbase. MVP testing and fast iteration allowed us to transform our clunky, subscription-based web system into a seamless, pay-per-use report delivery service, providing more value to our customers and increasing revenue.</p>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Unfortunately, a failure to reach a commercial agreement over the use of auction data lead to the eventual shutdown of the company.</p>

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Responsible for the daily operations of Wellington’s largest A La Carte fine dining restaurant. Management of stock, staff, and customers in a high quality, high pressure, high turnover environment. This varied from orchestrating weddings and corporate functions, to serving the Prime Minister, to running The Hobbit Premiere after party for the Cast &amp; Crew. The size of the establishment and the scale of the team demanded expertise, diplomacy, and constant communication - at which I excelled.</p>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Managing every detail of the customer experience from end-to-end, and working with passionate, talented people is what really drove me in this role. From the moment customers picked up the phone to make a reservation, till they posted a great review, providing a consistently high level of service was the number-one priority. In the interests of continuous improvement I implemented several internal initiatives, including composing menu glossaries and wine tasting notes to upskill and retain talented staff.</p>

        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">I spent the first ten years of my life in the south of Spain, growing up in a tiny village nestled in the Alpujarras. At age 11 my family moved to Nelson, New Zealand, where I attended Nelson College for seven years. I studied Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Canterbury for another two, before the earthquakes forced a move to Wellington. I cross-credited to a Software Development Diploma at Weltec which I completed while working full time.</p>
